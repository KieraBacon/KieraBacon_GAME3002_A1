README.txt

This is a small simulation of a soccer shootout.

Included in the repository are the complete project files which can be loaded in Unity version 2020.2.0f1, as well as the packaged project, included under the "Packaged" directory.

Once the program is running, either in Unity or via the packaged *.exe file, the player can control the ball using the mouse. Holding the Left Mouse Button will prepare a kick, the the strength of the kick determined by the length of time the button is held. If the player continues to hold the button, the strength will decrease and increase by turns until the button is released. When the player releases the Left Mouse Button, the ball will be kicked.

In addition the player can control the horizontal and vertical angles of the kick by moving the mouse horitontally and vertically after holding down the Left Mouse Button.

Getting the ball into the net will increase the score by 1, as displayed at the top of the screen.

There is also a... goalie... who will float back and forth and sometimes maybe think about pretending to try to get in the way of the player's oh-so-awesome kicking abilities.
